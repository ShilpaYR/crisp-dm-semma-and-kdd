# SEMMA Project — Step-by-step for a 6th Grader

**Dataset suggestion:** Student Performance (UCI) — predict pass/fail or scores

We’ll do this like a recipe. Follow each step in order. If something feels hard, that’s normal — go slowly and ask for help when stuck.

## The Plan
**Step 1: Sample** — We will do small tasks and check our work.
**Step 2: Explore** — We will do small tasks and check our work.
**Step 3: Modify** — We will do small tasks and check our work.
**Step 4: Model** — We will do small tasks and check our work.
**Step 5: Assess** — We will do small tasks and check our work.

- After each step, copy a question from `critique_prompts.md` and ask an AI helper to review your work like a strict teacher. Fix things and continue.
- Keep your code and notes in `notebook.ipynb`.
- When you finish, use `medium_draft.md` to write your story about the project.

You got this! 💪
