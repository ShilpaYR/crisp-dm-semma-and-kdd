# KDD Project

**Dataset suggestion:** Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle) — binary classification  
**Goal:** Complete **every phase** of the KDD lifecycle. Keep all artifacts here.

## Deliverables
- Fully executed `notebook.ipynb` with code, EDA, modeling, evaluation, and deployment/demo stub
- `medium_draft.md` turned into a published Medium post (link from here)
- `checklist.md` completed and checked
- Recorded walkthrough video (YouTube link here)
- All generated artifacts (plots, tables, exported models) committed

## Step-by-step (KDD)
- **1. Selection** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts
- **2. Preprocessing** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts
- **3. Transformation** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts
- **4. Data Mining** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts
- **5. Interpretation/Evaluation** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts

### Suggested dataset sources
- Kaggle or Papers with Code. Choose a dataset that matches this problem setting and is clean enough to finish in time.

### Notes
- Always run a critique after each phase using `critique_prompts.md` and iterate.
- Be explicit about mapping KDD phases to concrete tasks (e.g., Selection = choose target + features + rows).
- In the Data Mining phase, compare multiple algorithms and justify your choice.
