# CRISP-DM Project

**Dataset suggestion:** Retail sales forecasting — e.g., *Walmart Sales* (Kaggle)  
**Goal:** Complete **every phase** of the CRISP-DM lifecycle. Keep all artifacts here.

## Deliverables
- Fully executed `notebook.ipynb` with code, EDA, modeling, evaluation, and deployment/demo stub
- `medium_draft.md` turned into a published Medium post (link from here)
- `checklist.md` completed and checked
- Recorded walkthrough video (YouTube link here)
- All generated artifacts (plots, tables, exported models) committed

## Step-by-step (CRISP-DM)
- **1. Business Understanding** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts
- **2. Data Understanding** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts
- **3. Data Preparation** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts
- **4. Modeling** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts
- **5. Evaluation** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts
- **6. Deployment** — implement subtasks, document assumptions, save artifacts

### Suggested dataset sources
- Kaggle or Papers with Code. Choose a dataset that matches this problem setting and is clean enough to finish in time.

### Notes
- Always run a critique after each phase using `critique_prompts.md` and iterate.
- It’s okay if deployment is a *demo* (script, notebook widget, or Streamlit). Document clearly.
- Consider baseline → tuned model → post-hoc explainability (e.g., SHAP) for stakeholder trust.
